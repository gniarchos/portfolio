# ðŸ’» My Portfolio

This is my portfolio that contains all my updated projects.

Made with React and Typescript.

## ðŸš€ About Me

By breaking into University of West Attica at Informatics and Computer Engineering department, I found out my passion about Programming and Web Development. My portfolio showcases my ability to turn ideas into reality through the use of HTML CSS JavaScript React and other front-end and back-end technologies.
